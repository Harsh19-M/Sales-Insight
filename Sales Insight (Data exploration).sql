/*Additional Querying - Knowing more about our Data before Filtering and Cleaning*/

/*
'INR'
'INR\r'
'USD'
'USD\r'
*/
/*So this is what was creating the problem*/

- So really only just 2 original records using USD*/
select*
from transactions 
where currency = "USD" or currency = "USD\r";

select count(currency = 'INR')
from transactions 
where currency = 'INR';

select count(currency = 'INR\r')
from transactions

/*SO we can see that the transactions using USD and USD\r  are just duplicate records*/
select*
from transactions 
where currency = "USD" or currency = "USD\r";


/*So it would be beneficial/logical to keep both INR\r and USD\r currency values in our dashboard built in Power BI 
INR\r and USD\r currency values correspond to (are the same as) == [currency] = "INR#(cr)" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)" in Power BI
