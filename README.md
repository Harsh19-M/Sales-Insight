### Business Problem: 

Company: AtliQ Hardware
Industry: Computer Hardware & Peripherals
Head Office: Delhi, India
Sales Director: Bhavin Patel

Context: AtliQ Hardware supplies computer components and peripherals to major retail clients. As the market expands rapidly, the company struggles to track and analyze sales performance effectively across regions (North, South, and Central India).

Problem Statement: The Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, struggles to get a clear view of sales performance due to fragmented and unreliable reports by regional managers, limiting data-driven decision-making.


Challenge 1: 
Lack of Data-Backed Vision - Management lacks clear, data-driven visibility into performance by region, customer, and product category.

Challenge 2: 
Non-Effective Reporting - Regional managers provide verbal updates and inconsistent Excel reports. Sales insights are fragmented, manual, and time-consuming to interpret.

Challenge 3: 
Growth vs Overall Sales - Despite market growth, overall sales have been declining.
