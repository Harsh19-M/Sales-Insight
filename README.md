### Business Problem: 
Company: AtliQ Hardware
Industry: Computer Hardware & Peripherals
Head Office: Delhi, India
Sales Director: Bhavin Patel

Context: AtliQ Hardware supplies computer components and peripherals to major retail clients. As the market expands rapidly, the company struggles to track and analyze sales performance effectively across regions (North, South, and Central India).

Problem Statement: The Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, struggles to get a clear view of sales performance due to fragmented and unreliable reports by regional managers, limiting data-driven decision-making.


Challenge 1: 
Lack of Data-Backed Vision - Management lacks clear, data-driven visibility into performance by region, customer, and product category.

Challenge 2: 
Non-Effective Reporting - Regional managers provide verbal updates and inconsistent Excel reports. Sales insights are fragmented, manual, and time-consuming to interpret.

Challenge 3: 
Growth vs Overall Sales - Despite market growth, overall sales have been declining.

### Methodology:

SQL quereies that do such and such things to extract, explore data...

Power BI dashboard that is interactive and...


### Skills:

SQL: Joins, Aggregate functions, Case, Maybe Window Functions, (Maybe CTEs or Temp Tables)...

POwer BI: All the relevant Tools used...


### Results & Business Recommnedation: 
What are all the things Business Stakeholders care about? If it's a Product Project then think off stuff you'd speak with to the Product Manager 
But given ours is a Sales Insight Porject then suff we'll talk about witht the sales Director - Bhavin Patel (the one who gave you this mock project), maybe even stuff you'd
discuss with the Sales Manager etc. 

W.e Relevant stuff - Answers and results we found + Disscussions goes here...

### Next Steps: 
What would you work on if you had more time to work on this project - would you try different things, what're you thinking about next? Outside the Scope of just this Project. Thinking long-term and holistically about this Business. Also adress any limitations here data limitations|project limitations.
