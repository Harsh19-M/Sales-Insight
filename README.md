# Sales Insights Case Study – AtliQ Hardware
**A Data-Driven Sales Performance Dashboard built using SQL and Power BI**

## Executive Summary:

**Company**: AtliQ Hardware <br>
**Industry**: Computer Hardware & Peripherals<br>
**Head Office**: Delhi, India<br>
**Key Stakeholder**: Bhavin Patel, Sales Director<br>

Using SQL and Power BI, this project builds an interactive sales dashboard for AtliQ Hardware — a computer hardware manufacturer facing fragmented, unreliable sales reports. The dashboard consolidates sales data from multiple sources to help the Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, easily track key KPIs, identify performance trends, and make faster, 
data-driven decisions.

Key Outcomes:

* Centralized, accurate view of company-wide sales performance
* Automated reporting with real-time insights
* Improved sales visibility and data-driven decision-making


## Business Problem:

Context:
AtliQ Hardware supplies computer components and peripherals to major retail clients across India. As the market expands rapidly, the company struggles to track and analyze 
sales performance effectively across its regional divisions (North, South, and Central India).

Problem Statement:
Bhavin Patel lacks centralized visibility into AtliQ’s sales performance. Fragmented Excel files and inconsistent manual reporting from regional managers prevent timely and 
reliable business insights.


Key Challenges:
1. Lack of Data-Backed Insights: No single source of truth for performance by region, customer, or product category.
2. Inefficient Reporting: Manual Excel reports and verbal updates delay decision-making.
3. Sales Decline Despite Market Growth: Missed opportunities due to poor visibility and unstructured data.


## Methodology:

Framework Used: AIMS Grid *(Assumptions | Information | Methodology | Solutions)*

 1. Purpose:
 Define a structured plan to solve AtliQ’s reporting challenges by creating a unified, data-driven dashboard for real-time sales visibility and faster decision-making.

2. Stakeholders:
 Sales & Marketing Teams, IT Department (Falcons), Data Analytics Team (Data Masters).

3. End Result:
 A Power BI dashboard directly connected to AtliQ’s SQL sales database, consolidating regional performance data into a single interactive view.

4. Success Criteria:
 Reduced manual reporting time and cost, improved accessibility of sales insights, and a measurable uplift in data-driven strategic decisions.

## 🧩 Data Exploration & Modeling

### 🧠 **SQL Data Exploration (MySQL)**

Used SQL to explore and extract sales insights from AtliQ Hardware’s sales database, consisting of **5 tables**:
`Products`, `Date`, `Transactions`, `Customers`, and `Markets`.

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Key SQL Analyses</b></summary>

1. **Total Transactions**

   select count(sales_qty) as "Total Transactions" 
   from sales.transactions;
   

*Result:* **150,283 total transactions**

2. **Total Customers**

  select count(customer_code) as "Number of Total Records (Customers)"
  from sales.customers;

*Result:* **38 customers**

4. **Transactions in Chennai**

  select*
  from sales.transactions
  where market_code = "Mark001";
   
*Result:* Transactions filtered for **Chennai (Mark001)**

**Also Total Number of Transactions in Chennai**

  select count(*) as "Total # of Transactions in Chennai"
  from sales.transactions
  where market_code = 'Mark001';


5. **Transactions using USD Currency**

  select*
  from sales.transactions 
  where currency = "USD";

*Result:* **transaction details using USD currency**

**AND if we are strictly looking for the count only - as in how many in total (using USD) then we simply do this:**

  select count(*) as "Total Number of Transactions using USD currency"
  from sales.transactions
  where currency = "USD";

*Result:* **2 transactions in USD**


6. **Show All Transactions only in 2020 joined with the date table**

  select*
  from sales.transactions as T
  inner join sales.date as D on D.date = T.order_date
  where D.year = 2020;

**AND if we only want a count of how many total transactions took place only in the year 2020**

  select count(*) as "Total Transactions in Year 2020"
  from sales.transactions as T 
  inner join sales.date as D on D.date = T.order_date
  where D.year = 2020;

*Result:* **21550 transactions took place in the year of 2020**/


7. **We want to know total Revenue Generated only in the year 2020**
   
  select sum(T.sales_amount) as "Total Revenue in 2020"
  from sales.transactions as T
  join sales.date as D on D.date = T.order_date
  where D.year = 2020;

  select sum(T.sales_amount) as "Total Revenue 2019"
  from sales.transactions as T
  join sales.date as D on D.date = T.order_date
  where D.year = 2019 and T.currency = "INR";

  select sum(T.sales_amount) as "Total Revenue 2018"
  from sales.transactions as T
  join sales.date as D on D.date = T.order_date
  where D.year = 2018 and T.currency = "INR";

   *Results:*

   * **2020:** ₹142,235,559
   * **2019:** ₹433,012
   * **2018:** ₹621,779

*(Revenue trend shows decline year-over-year.)*
   

8. **We want to know the Total Revenue Generated only from/in Chennai in the year 2020**

select sum(T.sales_amount) as "Total Revenue - Chennai (2020)"
from sales.transactions as T
join sales.markets as M on M.markets_code = T.market_code
join sales.date as D on D.date = T.order_date 
where markets_code = 'Mark001' and year = 2020;

*Results:*

   * **Total Revenue - Chennai (2020):** ₹2,463,024



9. **Distinct Products sold in Chennai and we want it to be by most sold product to least sold**
    
  select P.product_code, M.markets_code, M.markets_name, P.product_type, sum(T.sales_amount) as "Total Sales"
  from sales.transactions as T
  join sales.products as P on P.product_code = T.product_code
  join sales.markets as M on M.markets_code = T.market_code
  where M.markets_code = "Mark001" 
  group by P.product_code, P.product_type, M.markets_code
  order by sum(T.sales_amount) desc;


10. **Top 5 Most Profitable Markets**

### 📊 **Power BI Data Modeling**

After generating SQL insights, the dataset was imported into **Power BI** for visualization and relationship modeling.

**Steps Taken:**

* Imported all 5 tables into Power BI: `Products`, `Customers`, `Markets`, `Date`, `Transactions`.
* Organized tables in a **Star Schema** — with `Transactions` as the **Fact Table**.
* **Automatic Relationships:**

  * `Products` ↔ `Transactions` (via `product_code`)
  * `Customers` ↔ `Transactions` (via `customer_code`)
* **Manual Relationships (created in Model View):**

  * `Markets` ↔ `Transactions` (`markets_code` ↔ `market_code`)
  * `Date` ↔ `Transactions` (`date` ↔ `order_date`)

This ensured proper relational integrity for building measures, aggregations, and visualizations.
